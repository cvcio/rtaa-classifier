# RTAA-72

> last updated at July 17, 2021

Target Audience Analysis (TAA), as described by many field manuals such as [FM 33-1-1](https://fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-05-301.pdf), is the transitional phase where PSYOP planning moves toward execution, where all communications must be tailored to the local dynamics of the targeted audience in order to be successhfull. In conjuction with modern infromation warfare, which is about corrupting information processing systems and the way they operate, any social media such as Twitter, can be used to distribute and disseminate information in order to manipulate public opinion more efficient, more accurate and in real-time get the feedback and adapt to the conditions. A way to interrupt this proccess is by continuosly monitor these elements (distributors and messages), or at least establish a transparent mechanism to do so.

***Reverse* Target Audience Analysis**, is [CVCIO](https://cvcio.org)'s gRPC multi classification service where we try to reverse engineer this process, by tracking inauthentic account activity and the narratives they are trying to push forward.
